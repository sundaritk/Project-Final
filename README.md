# Project-Final

## Requirements:
1. Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing.
2. Use ML in the context of technologies learned.
3. You must use: Scikit-Learn and/or another machine learning library.
4. You must use at least two of the below:
  * Python Pandas
  * Python Matplotlib
  * HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
  * JavaScript Plotly
  * JavaScript D3.js
  * JavaScript Leaflet
  * SQL Database

  ## Project Details:
1. Download audio files from RAVDESS & extract features and load them in Postgres DB.
2. Use machine learning to create models .
3. Use Parselmouth to extract the feature (Intensity,Spectrogram,Jitter,Shimmer,Pitch etc )
and use Plotly to display them.
4. Bootstrap/HTML/CSS/Js for interactive visualization.
5. We would like to do following analysis once we have completed our model:
a. Python library-librosa for Speech Analysis Vs. our model.
b. Manipulate features and recreate speech with librosa.
